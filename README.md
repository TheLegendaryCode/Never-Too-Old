# Never-Too-Old
‘Never Too Old’ is an app designed for aid of all the senior citizens around the world. I have tried to provide a simple easy to use friendly app that can help solve some common problems that our elderly face.


Some of the key problems that pushed me towards designing this app are: 

1.It is proven that the bones and muscles start degenerating after the age of 45. This leads to delicate and weak bones and muscles in old age.

2.It is proven that hormones and proteins that protect and repair brain cells and stimulate neural growth also decline with age. Older people often experience decreased blood     flow to the brain, which can impair memory and lead to changes in cognitive skills. This means that the elderly people forget stuff easily and their memory power starts         weakening after the age of 60. It becomes common for them to forget taking important medicines.

3.During old age its recommended to not stay alone and have some company always with them. But the children of many of the elderly people have a 9 to 6 job and they cannot be     with their parents all the time. So if there is an emergency and no one is present with the elderly person it can be hazardous.

4.It is also proven that the immunity of important organs starts weakening after the age of 45 which makes them vulnerable to diseases and illnesses.


How does my app ‘Never Too Old’ help:

  1.Exercises: As I mentioned that the bones and muscles start degenerating in old age. To help this I have added important but easy exercises that are globally proven to slow     down the degenerative processes.
  
  2.Pill Reminders: As we are aware of memory power weakening in old age and the elderly forgetting to take their medicines, I have added a medicine reminder where you can add     the name of the medicine, time of taking it and on what days you have to take it. Once you set it up in the app, it gives a clear alarm alert telling you to take your           medicine when it’s time for it.
  
  3.Emergency Alert: Its suggested that elderly always have some sort of company with them. But there can be times when they are alone and some sort of emergency takes place.       In my app I have made an alert button which initiates a call to an emergency contact which is given on the sign up.
  
  4.Breathing Exercises: As I spoke about the problems around weakening of immunity, I have provided 2 types of easy but highly beneficial breathing exercises. The first is to     strengthen your body organs and the second is the breathing exercise created by Buddha himself known as The Tibetan Healing Breath which is focused on stress relieving and     cleaning your aura.
